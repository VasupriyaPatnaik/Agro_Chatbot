4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

5. **Ensure you have the required files**:
   - `app.py` (Flask application)
   - `knowledge_base.json` (Crop disease database)
   - `templates/index.html` (Web interface)

## Usage

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and go to:

## API Usage

AgroBot also provides a REST API endpoint for programmatic access:

```bash
POST /diagnose
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "crop": "Tomato",
  "symptom": "yellow leaves with brown edges"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "crop": "Tomato",
    "symptom": "yellow leaves starting from bottom with brown edges",
    "possible_issue": "Nitrogen deficiency",
    "severity": "Medium",
    "season": "All seasons, more common in rainy season",
    "prevention": "Ensure proper soil fertility with compost, rotate crops with legumes...",
    "treatment": "Apply urea (100-150kg/ha) or organic compost to restore nitrogen",
    "organic_treatment": "Apply compost tea or fish emulsion, use legume cover crops"
  }
}
```

## Knowledge Base Format

The `knowledge_base.json` file contains entries in the following format:

```json
{
  "crop": "Tomato",
  "symptom": "yellow leaves starting from bottom with brown edges",
  "possible_issue": "Nitrogen deficiency",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "season": "All seasons, more common in rainy season",
  "prevention": "Ensure proper soil fertility with compost...",
  "treatment": "Apply urea (100-150kg/ha) or organic compost...",
  "organic_treatment": "Apply compost tea or fish emulsion..."
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Crop Information

1. Edit the `knowledge_base.json` file
2. Add new entries following the existing format
3. Restart the Flask application

### Modifying the Interface

Edit `templates/index.html` to:
- Change colors and styling
- Add new UI elements
- Modify the chatbot behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application won't start**:
   - Ensure Flask is installed: `pip install flask`
   - Check Python version: `python --version` (requires Python 3.6+)

2. **No diagnoses found**:
   - Verify `knowledge_base.json` exists in the same directory
   - Check the JSON format is valid

3. **Import errors**:
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed
   - Try reactivating the virtual environment

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all files are in the correct location
2. Verify the knowledge_base.json format is valid JSON
3. Ensure you're using a supported Python version
